## üîß Alternative: Use App Store Connect CLI

If you have access to a Mac with Xcode installed, you can also verify your credentials:

```bash
# Test your API key credentials
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/ContentDeliveryServices.framework/Frameworks/AppStoreService.framework/Support/altool \
  --list-apps \
  --apiKey 923FC92FTY \
  --apiIssuer [YOUR_ISSUER_ID]
```

This should return a list of your apps if the credentials are correct.

## üìã Verification Checklist

- [ ] Found Issuer ID in App Store Connect
- [ ] Issuer ID is in UUID format (8-4-4-4-12 characters)
- [ ] Updated GitHub secret `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID`
- [ ] API key shows as "Active" in App Store Connect
- [ ] API key has "App Manager" role

---

## üéØ Expected Result

After updating the Issuer ID, your next deployment should show:
```
‚úÖ Successfully uploaded to App Store Connect
```

Instead of the 401 authentication error.

## üí° Pro Tip

The Issuer ID is the same for all API keys in your Apple Developer account. If you have other API keys, they all use the same Issuer ID.
