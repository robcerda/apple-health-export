## Information We Collect

### Health Data
- **What**: The app accesses health data from Apple's HealthKit framework, including but not limited to: steps, heart rate, sleep data, workouts, body measurements, and other health metrics
- **How**: Data is accessed only with your explicit permission through iOS's built-in health permissions system

## How We Use Your Information

### Health Data Processing

- **Export Generation**: Health data is used solely to create export files in JSON or SQLite format
- **No Remote Transmission**: Health data never leaves your device unless you explicitly share export files
- **No Permanent Storage**: The app does not store health data; it only reads and processes it temporarily

### Data Export Features
- **File Creation**: Export files are created and stored locally on your device
- **Encryption**: Optional AES-256-GCM encryption for export files using passwords you provide
- **Auto-Export**: Scheduled exports (if enabled) are processed locally without external communication

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

### Third Parties
- **No Third-Party Services**: The app does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks
- **No Data Sharing**: We do not share, sell, rent, or otherwise disclose your health data to any third parties
- **No External SDKs**: The app uses only Apple's native frameworks and contains no third-party software libraries

### User-Controlled Sharing
- **Export Files**: You maintain complete control over export files and can share them at your discretion
- **iOS Sharing**: Any sharing occurs through iOS's built-in sharing mechanisms that you initiate

## Data Security

### Technical Safeguards
- **Local Processing**: All data processing occurs on-device using iOS security features
- **HealthKit Security**: Leverages Apple's secure HealthKit framework and permissions system
- **File Encryption**: Optional AES-256-GCM encryption for export files
- **No Network Activity**: The app makes zero network requests and functions entirely offline

### Data Protection
- **iOS Security**: Benefits from iOS built-in security features including app sandboxing and secure storage
- **Permission Controls**: Utilizes iOS health permissions system for granular access control
- **Code Transparency**: Open-source codebase allows for security auditing and verification

## Your Privacy Rights

### HealthKit Permissions
- **Granular Control**: You can grant or deny access to specific health data types
- **Revoke Access**: You can revoke health data permissions at any time through iOS Settings
- **Permission Transparency**: The app clearly indicates which health data types it requests access to

### Data Control
- **Export Ownership**: You own and control all export files created by the app
- **File Management**: You can delete, move, or share export files as desired
- **App Removal**: Uninstalling the app removes all associated data and permissions

## Data Retention

### App Data

- **Export Files**: Only the export files you create are saved to your device's local storage
- **User Deletion**: You can delete export files at any time through the iOS Files app or app interface

### App Uninstallation
- **Complete Removal**: Uninstalling the app removes all associated data, settings, and permissions
- **No Residual Data**: No data remains on your device or any external systems after app removal

## Children's Privacy

This app is not directed to children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app is designed for individuals managing their own health data and requires users to be of an age where they can make informed decisions about their health data.

## International Data Transfers
